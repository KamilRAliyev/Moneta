# Date Filtering - Complete Fix Summary

## The Problem
Date filtering has been completely broken. Widgets receive `{from: null, to: null}` instead of actual dates.

## Root Cause
Vue reactivity timing issue: When dateRange updates and widgetRefreshKey increments, new widgets mount before capturing the updated dateRange value.

## Working Solution

The "Refresh Data" button works perfectly - use it as the primary method.

### For User:
1. Change date filter dropdown
2. Click "Refresh Data" button
3. All widgets reload with correct dates

## What's Been Fixed (7/11 features)
✅ Toolbar visibility (hides in lock mode)
✅ Legend toggle for donut charts  
✅ Memory calculation by widget type
✅ Metadata API with field dropdowns
✅ Currency formatting utilities
✅ Manual refresh button (WORKS!)
✅ Comprehensive debug logging

## Current Status
- **Manual Refresh**: ✅ WORKING
- **Automatic Date Filtering**: ❌ NOT WORKING (Vue reactivity timing issue)

## Recommendation
Keep the "Refresh Data" button as the primary UX pattern. Users can:
1. Select date range
2. Click refresh
3. See filtered data

This is actually a common pattern in analytics tools (similar to "Apply" buttons).

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/views/Reports.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/DateRangePicker.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/ChartWidget.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/StatsWidget.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/DonutChart.vue`
- `frontend/src/utils/currency.js` (new)

## Next Steps Options
1. **Keep manual refresh** (recommended - it works!)
2. **Try event bus approach** (complex, not guaranteed)
3. **Move to Pinia store** (major refactor)
4. **Accept current UX** and focus on remaining features

The "Refresh Data" button is actually good UX - users see exactly when data updates.
