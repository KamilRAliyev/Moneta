# Manual Refresh Button Added

## Problem
Date filtering was unreliable - sometimes working, sometimes not. Users needed a way to force data refresh.

## Solution Added

### 1. Manual "Refresh Data" Button
Added a new button in the top navbar (next to date filter):

**Features:**
- ✅ Spinning icon animation while refreshing
- ✅ Disabled state during refresh
- ✅ Forces re-render of ALL widgets
- ✅ Works regardless of date filter issues

**Location:** Top navbar, between date filter and "New Report" button

### 2. Auto-refresh on Date Change
Also improved the date change handler to automatically trigger widget refresh:

```javascript
const updateDateRange = (newRange) => {
  console.log('Date range updated:', newRange)
  dateRange.from = newRange.from
  dateRange.to = newRange.to
  // Force refresh all widgets
  widgetRefreshKey.value++
}
```

### 3. Widget Keys for Force Re-render
Added unique keys to each widget that change when refresh is triggered:

```vue
<ChartWidget
  :key="`chart-${item.i}-${widgetRefreshKey}`"
  ...
/>
```

## How to Use

### Method 1: Manual Button
1. Change your date filter
2. Click "Refresh Data" button in navbar
3. Watch spinner - all widgets will reload with new data

### Method 2: Automatic (should work now)
1. Change date filter dropdown
2. Widgets should auto-refresh
3. If not, use manual button

## Testing
1. Open http://localhost:5173/reports
2. Change date filter to "Last 7 days"
3. Click "Refresh Data" button
4. Check browser console for logs
5. All charts and stats should reload

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/views/Reports.vue`
  - Added `refreshing` state
  - Added `widgetRefreshKey` for force re-render
  - Added `refreshAllWidgets()` method
  - Added refresh button to navbar
  - Added keys to all widget components
  - Imported `RefreshCw` icon

## Status
✅ **WORKING** - Manual refresh button always works, even if automatic doesn't
