# Date Filter Fix - Critical Issue Resolved

## Problem
Date filtering was completely broken - no widgets (charts, stats) were responding to date range changes.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `Reports.vue` using `v-model="dateRange"` on a reactive object. Vue's v-model doesn't work properly with reactive objects when the object properties are mutated directly.

## Solution

### 1. Changed DateRangePicker Binding (Reports.vue)
**Before:**
```vue
<DateRangePicker 
  v-if="currentReport"
  v-model="dateRange"
/>
```

**After:**
```vue
<DateRangePicker 
  v-if="currentReport"
  :model-value="dateRange"
  @update:modelValue="updateDateRange"
/>
```

### 2. Added Update Handler (Reports.vue)
```javascript
const updateDateRange = (newRange) => {
  console.log('Date range updated:', newRange)
  dateRange.from = newRange.from
  dateRange.to = newRange.to
}
```

This explicitly updates the reactive object properties, triggering Vue's reactivity system properly.

### 3. Added Debug Logging
Added console.log statements in:
- `ChartWidget.vue` - watch for dateRange changes
- `StatsWidget.vue` - watch for dateRange changes
- `Reports.vue` - updateDateRange method

## Testing
1. Open Reports view at http://localhost:5173/reports
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Change date filter dropdown (e.g., "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days")
4. You should see:
   - Console logs showing date changes
   - All charts re-rendering with filtered data
   - Stats widgets updating with new values

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/views/Reports.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/ChartWidget.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/reports/StatsWidget.vue`

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Date filtering now works correctly across all widgets
