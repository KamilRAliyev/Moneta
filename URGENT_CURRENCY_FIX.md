# URGENT: Get Currency Showing RIGHT NOW

## The Simplest Solution (30 seconds per widget)

Your widgets are configured correctly, but need to be **toggled** to apply formatting.

### Do This For Each Widget:

1. **Click "Edit Mode"** (top right)
2. **Click the "Refresh Data" button** (next to date picker)
3. **Done!** Check if $ appears

If that doesn't work:

1. **Click Edit Mode**
2. **Click widget** (gets blue ring)
3. **In FloatingToolbar**, change:
   - Currency Mode: **"From Data Field"** â†’ **"Fixed Currency"**
   - Currency Code: Type **"USD"**
4. **Click another widget or press ESC**
5. **Repeat for all money widgets**

## Why It's Not Showing

The widgets were saved with currency config **before** I added the auto-USD defaulting code. You need to either:
- Refresh the data (triggers new fetch with new code)
- OR change the config (triggers update)

## Test After Refreshing

1. Open Console (F12)
2. Click "Refresh Data" button
3. Look for: `ðŸ’° Using field mode, defaulting to USD`
4. If you see that, charts should show $

## If Still Not Working

**Switch ALL widgets to Fixed Currency mode:**

It's simpler and more reliable:

1. Edit Mode ON
2. For each chart/stat:
   - Click it
   - Currency Mode â†’ "Fixed Currency (Recommended)"
   - Currency Code â†’ "USD"
3. Done!

This bypasses the field detection entirely and just applies USD formatting directly.

## Console Check

After refresh, you should see in console:
```
ðŸ”¥ ChartWidget MOUNTED with dateRange: ...
ðŸ”¥ ChartWidget currency config: {currency_mode: "field", currency_field: "computed_currency", currency_code: null}
ðŸ“Š ChartWidget fetching data...
ðŸ’° Using field mode, defaulting to USD (field: computed_currency)
ðŸ“Š Single series data with currency: USD
```

If you see `currency: USD` in the last line, the currency IS being set. The issue would then be in the chart rendering.

## Nuclear Option: Start Fresh

If nothing works:

1. Click each widget
2. Currency Mode â†’ "none"
3. Save (click away)
4. Click widget again
5. Currency Mode â†’ "Fixed Currency"
6. Currency Code â†’ "USD"
7. Save

This completely resets the currency config.
