## 🧪 RECOMMENDED: Testing & Verification

### Should Test in Browser:
1. **Test Each Chart Type:**
   - [ ] BarChart - Toggle axes, change grid style
   - [ ] LineChart - Toggle axes, disable animations
   - [ ] AreaChart - Test all axis configs
   - [ ] DonutChart - Test animations
   - [ ] TreemapChart - Test financial colors
   - [ ] HeatmapChart - Test axis configs
   - [ ] WaterfallChart - Test grid styles
   - [ ] StackedBarChart - Test label rotation
   - [ ] ScatterChart - Test axis toggles
   - [ ] BubbleChart - Test all configs
   - [ ] SankeyChart - Verify no regressions

2. **Test Each Configuration Option:**
   - [ ] Show/hide X-axis
   - [ ] Show/hide Y-axis
   - [ ] Grid style: None
   - [ ] Grid style: Dots
   - [ ] Grid style: Dashed
   - [ ] Grid style: Solid
   - [ ] Label rotation slider
   - [ ] Enable/disable animations
   - [ ] Animation speed slider
   - [ ] Financial colors checkbox
   - [ ] Color scheme selector

3. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - [ ] Charts with no data
   - [ ] Charts with negative values
   - [ ] Charts with mixed positive/negative
   - [ ] Very large datasets
   - [ ] Very small datasets

## 💡 OPTIONAL: Future Enhancements

### Not Critical, But Could Be Nice:

#### 1. **ScatterChart Raw Data Support** (Optional)
**Current State:** ScatterChart uses aggregated data (one point per category)
**Potential Enhancement:** 
- Add backend endpoint for raw transaction data
- Show individual transactions as separate points
- Add pagination for large datasets

**When to do this:** Only if you specifically need individual transaction points on scatter charts

#### 2. **Chart Export Features** (Optional)
We created `chartExport.js` utility, but it's not fully integrated yet:
- [ ] Export charts as PNG/SVG
- [ ] Export chart data as CSV
- [ ] Copy chart to clipboard
- [ ] Print-optimized layouts

#### 3. **Advanced Chart Features** (Optional)
- [ ] Zoom and pan on charts
- [ ] Brush selection on line/area charts
- [ ] Drill-down on hierarchical charts
- [ ] Real-time data updates
- [ ] Chart annotations

#### 4. **Performance Optimizations** (Optional)
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- [ ] Web Workers for heavy computations
- [ ] Canvas rendering for very large charts (instead of SVG)
- [ ] Data sampling for performance

#### 5. **Accessibility Improvements** (Optional)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for charts
- [ ] Screen reader support
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] Text alternatives for chart data
